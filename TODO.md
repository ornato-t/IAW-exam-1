- Style personal frontend page
  - landlord version extends renter version
    - because of this, landlord should view their requests and visits (as customer) after their own apartments
    - landlord views requests first, then their apartments, then their visit
      - same layout for apartments
      - list (no card) layout for requests
  - client vies their request firsts, then their visits
